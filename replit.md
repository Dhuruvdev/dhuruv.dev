# Overview

HACKFIRST is a cybersecurity-themed portfolio website showcasing advanced cyberattack simulations and security projects. The application features a visually rich, scroll-based single-page design with smooth animations powered by GSAP and Framer Motion. The site includes an animated video loader intro, multiple pinned scroll sections with video backgrounds, and a project showcase highlighting various cybersecurity tools and applications.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for build tooling

**Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- Single-page application with main Home route
- 404 fallback for undefined routes

**UI Component System**: Shadcn UI with Radix UI primitives
- Comprehensive component library using "new-york" style variant
- TailwindCSS v4 for styling with custom dark theme
- Custom color scheme with black background and white foreground
- Three custom font families: Inter (sans), Libre Baskerville (serif), Space Mono (mono)

**Animation Strategy**: Dual animation library approach
- GSAP with ScrollTrigger for scroll-based pinned sections and timeline animations
- Framer Motion for component-level animations and transitions
- Lenis for smooth scroll behavior
- Custom blur-to-focus video reveal animations on scroll

**State Management**: 
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state with infinite stale time
- No complex client state management needed for current feature set

**Video Asset Management**:
- Multiple video assets stored in `attached_assets` directory
- Custom VideoLoader component with 6-second intro sequence
- Video backgrounds in scroll sections with programmatic playback control

## Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript

**Development Setup**: 
- Vite dev server with HMR for development
- Custom middleware mode integration between Express and Vite
- Separate client and server build processes

**Storage Pattern**: 
- Abstract storage interface (`IStorage`) for data operations
- In-memory storage implementation (`MemStorage`) as default
- Designed for easy swap to database-backed storage

**API Structure**:
- RESTful API with `/api` prefix for all routes
- Custom logging middleware for request/response tracking
- Raw body preservation for webhook/payment processing

## Database & ORM

**ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts` for type sharing between client/server
- Currently implements basic User model with username/password
- Zod integration for runtime validation via drizzle-zod
- Migration support through drizzle-kit

**Database Provider**: Configured for Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- Uses `@neondatabase/serverless` driver
- Connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Schema designed to work with `gen_random_uuid()` for primary keys

## Build & Deployment

**Build Process**:
- Vite builds client to `dist/public`
- ESBuild bundles server with selective dependency bundling
- Allowlist approach for critical dependencies to reduce cold start times
- Production server serves static files from dist/public

**Static File Serving**:
- Client-side routing fallback to index.html
- Public assets served from client/public directory

**Replit Integration**:
- Custom Vite plugin for updating OpenGraph meta tags with Replit deployment URL
- Runtime error overlay plugin for development
- Cartographer and dev banner plugins in development mode
